        Simple to put together with only 4 ingredients,
         but big on flavor! I like to use "extra jumbo" size shrimp, which are 16-20 per pound.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>16 jumbo Shrimp, fresh, raw</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>8 Strips thin sliced bacon, cut in half</li>
        <li>16 toothpicks</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons hot honey</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place shrimp on a plate and sprinkle both sides with Cajun seasoning. Wrap each shrimp with 1 narrow strip of bacon and fasten with a toothpick. Refrigerate for 25 to 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Air-fry shrimp for 3 minutes. Flip and continue cooking until bacon is lightly crispy, 4 to 5 minutes more. You may have to do 2 batches depending on the size of your air fryer</li>
        <li>Remove shrimp to a plate and drizzle with hot honey. Serve immediately, being watchful of any toothpicks.</li>
    </ol>
